 * copy past as below:

Welcome to my page, I'd like to take you on a journey through the world of music and beyond.

<image>

My story began in the picturesque city of Thessaloniki, Greece, back in 2013. That's when I first set foot in the world of higher education, embarking on a path that would define my life. I dedicated myself to the art of Music Composition, earning both a Bachelor's and Master's degree from Aristotle University. It was there that I had the privilege of studying under the mentorship of Prof. Michalis Lapidakis and several other accomplished composers.

In 2020, I decided to set sail for new horizons. I joined the Master's Programme in "Arts and Technologies of Sound" at Ionian University, delving deeper into the fascinating realm of sound. And, believe it or not, my insatiable curiosity led me to explore the world of psychology with further academic studies in this direction.

Today, my creative compass points towards electronic compositions, music programming, and multimedia creations. I'm passionate about blending acoustic instruments with digital elements, creating experiences that bridge the auditory and visual realms. In my years in Aristotle University, I'd co-founded the project "Echotopia," merging music performance and visuals. Along the way, I decided to run other projects that combines those two elements as an indepentent/session artist.

My main interest at the moment is to create music projects that harmonize music performance with captivating visuals.

Among my musical accomplishments are  participating in enlightening master classes, academic seminars, conferences and symposiums, and witnessing my compositions come to life on prestigious stages like the Thessaloniki Concert Hall.

But I'm not just a composer. I'm also a versatile musician with diplomas in flute performance, harmony, and counterpoint. I am current a student in fugue style composition at Ano's Polis Concervatory in Thessaloniki. Throughout my journey, I've played a variety of instruments, from guitar and piano to flute, and I've been part of numerous musical ensembles. In 2020, I even took up a seat in an improvisation ensemble, 6daEXIt.

In addition to my musical adventures, I work as an orchestrator for the flute orchestra 'Sin+Avlites,' where I'm also an active member. I contribute to the Orchestra of Ano Poli's Conservatory as well. Since 2017, I've had the privilege of sharing my musical expertise through private sessions and with students in various institutions.

I'm more than just a composer; I'm a curious mind always seeking new avenues of creative expression. Join me on this journey, and let's explore the captivating worlds of music, psychology, visuals and everything in between.
